# Show Food Trucks
I packed everything into a single file so that I was sure there would
be no issues running the code. If I were building a product I would
split things out. Details below.

## Install dependencies
'''pip install sodapy'''
                                                                                                                                                        
Make sure you have sodapy installed.                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                        
> pip install sodapy                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                        
To run:                                                                                                                                                 
> python show_open_food_trucks.py
